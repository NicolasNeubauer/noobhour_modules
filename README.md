# noobhour modules
A collection of modules for [VCV Rack](https://github.com/VCVRack/Rack):

- **Baseliner**, a 4x probabilistic attenuverting switch. 
- **Bsl1r**, a single-channel **Baseliner**
- **Customscaler**, a quantizer for custom, CV-modifiable scales.
- **Normaliser**, an attenuator scaling values to an output range.

## Baseliner
A 4x probabilistic attenuverting switch. 

![Baseliner](./doc/Baseliner.png)

**Baseliner** returns one of two possible signals (**High** or **Low**), based
on a gate input. In its basic state, it will return **High** if
the gate is active and **Low** otherwise. 

"I see that **Low** defaults to 0, so are you saying you re-invented the
AND gate?" Yea, kind of (awesome, no?). But there are a number of ways
to modify this basic behaviour which I often find useful in turning
raw CV into music. They relate to shaping **High** and **Low**,
and to deciding which signal to return.

### Signal shaping 

The original motivation for this module was to pass on a signal if
gate is on, but have it fall back to a definable baseline, not just 0,
when it's off, hence its name. 

The ways the two signals can be shaped are the same for both; the only
difference is when they are returned. Both **High** and **Low** are computed
as their respective input * **att** + **abs**. If no input is given, this
lets you dial in a constant value via **abs** (-5V..5V). Once you provide
an input, you can offset it using **abs** and attenuate it via **att**, which
is an "attenuverter" i.e. also lets you invert the signal as its value
can be set from -1 to 1. Outputs are clipped to -10V..10V.


### Signal selection

The controls in the darker, lower area of the module can be used to
modify which signal is returned when.

Besides the regular **Gate** mode, there are two modes, **Latch** and **Toggle**,
which behave like the modes in
[Audible Instruments](https://github.com/VCVRack/AudibleInstruments)
Bernoulli Gate (a software implementation of
[Mutable Instruments Branches](https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/branches/)).
There is also a probability input which is computed as the sum of the
knob value (0..1) and the CV input.

- In **Gate** mode, **High** is returned if **Gate** is on - but only with
  probability **p**, determined each time **Gate** triggers (switches from off
  to on).

- In **Latch** mode, **Gate** is only used as a trigger: When it triggers, the
  output switches to **High** with probability **p** or to **Low** otherwise.

- In **Toggle** mode, **Gate** is only used as a trigger as well: When it
  triggers, the output switches from **Low** to **High** or from **High** to
  **Low** with probability **p**.
  
 
### Daisy-chaining

Gates are normalized to the left and the outputs are normalized to the right:

- Any unpatched **Gate**will receive its value
  from its first patched input from the left.
- Any unpatched output will contribute its value to the right. The
  next patched output will return the sum of its own value plus
  all potential unpatched outputs to its left (until there is another
  patched output to the left).
- Note that in earlier versions, **High** and **Low** were also normalized
  to the left, but this was discarded, as it complicated having a proper 
  zero baseline. 

### Polyphony

If **High** or **Low** inputs are polyphonic, their polyphony will be passed 
through according to **Gate** and **att** and **abs** modifications will be 
applied to each channel.

When daisy-chaining columns with different numbers of active channels,
single-channel columns will be added to all channels of polyphonic other columns.
For example, if column 1 outputs two channels and column 2 only one,
and output 1 is unpatched, the output 2 will be
`(column1.channel1 + column2.channel1, column1.channel2 + column2.channel1)`.
However, if column 1 has 3 channels and column 2 has 2, output 2 will be
`(column1.channel1 + column2.channel1, column1.channel2 + column2.channel2, column1.channel3 + 0)`.

### Patching suggestions

- If you don't provide any input but just raise **High**'s **abs** value,
  gate triggers will create another gate trigger at the output,
  allowing you to e.g. modify the probability of the trigger passing
  through.
- If you send signals only to **Low** and patch the right-most output,
  you have an improvised mixer where **att** controls the volume.

as a rhythm generator, mixer, distorter, melody creator, and drum
sequencer.

## Bsl1r
A single-channel **Baseliner**.

![Bsl1r](./doc/Bsl1r.png)


## Customscaler
A quantizer for custom, CV-modifiable scales.

![Customscaler](./doc/Customscaler.png)

**Customscaler** turns a continuous input signal into V/Oct output, scaling
the input value over the tones selected in the matrix. By default, it
expects a 0V..10V input, but the context menu allows to switch to
-5V..5V inputs. The input is distributed evenly over the activated
tones, so if you have CDEF activated, 0-2.499...V will trigger the C,
2.5V-4.99...V will trigger D and so on. The center light in the bottom
row corresponds to a V/Oct output of 0, C4 if fed into an otherwise
unmodulated oscillator. Each row further up represents one half-tone
higher, whereas columns to the left and right represent lower and
higher octaves, respectively.

Next to the matrix, there are two areas with controls: The upper one
contains all controls related to playing an existing scale, the lower
one modifies the scale matrix.

### Playing

- **in** receives the CV to be turned into V/Oct. 
- **oct range** controls which of the octaves are used.
- **v/oct** sends the computed V/Oct.
- **change** sends a trigger everytime v/oct changes. 
- **base** adds up to 11 half-tones to the output.
- **base cv** expects a -10V..10V input, adding -11 to 11 half-tones to
  the **base** knobs setting; the final base value will still be 0..11 (C
  to B,if you will).

### Modifying 

- **v/oct** receives a frequency. If the tone has a corresponding light
  on the matrix, it will be toggled when **toggle** receives a
  trigger. This means you can control the matrix from e.g. a keyboard
  or a sequencer (or another **Customscaler**, gasp). The **base** offset is
  not taken into consideration.
  
- **random** randomizes which tones are selected in the matrix,
  according to **p** and **latch/toggle**, see below. 
  
  When you first trigger **random**, it will consider all active tones
  and determine whether to leave them on or off.  If a tone is turned
  off, it will remain a "candidate" (yellow), such that at a future
  **random** trigger, it will be reconsidered for activation. Like
  this, you can define a
  scale and randomly select parts of it using this function.
  
  If no tone is active when **random** receives a trigger, all tones
  become candidates, such that a truly random selection across all
  tones occurs, similar to the behaviour of the *randomize* trigger in
  an earlier version of **Customscaler**.
  
- **p** and **latch/toggle** determine the behaviour when **random** is triggered.

	**p** is computed as the sum of the knob value and the CV input,
    clamped to 0..1.

	In **latch** mode, a tone will be activated with probability
    **p**.
	
	In **toggle** mode, a tone will be *toggled* with probability
    **p**. This lets you, for example, create slowly changes in the
    scale over time, versus a complete re-roll on every **random**
    trigger as created by the **latch** mode.
	
	As noted in the **Baseliner** documentation, this behaviour is modeled
	after the Bernoulli gate / Branches module.


- **reset** will turn off all lights on the matrix. 

### Polyphony

If **in** is polyphonic, **v/oct** and **change** will be polyphonic as well,
applying the different channels' input to the same scale and independently firing
change gates when the resulting pitch changes.

As of 1.0.3, the **toggle** and corresponding **v/oct** inputs are polyphonic 
as well. When a gate on channel *c* of **toggle** is received, the tone on 
channel *c* of **v/oct** is toggled.

## Normaliser
An attenuator scaling values to an output range.

![Normaliser](./doc/Normaliser.png)

**Normaliser** returns the input signal sent to **in**, scaled to a
range from **min** to **max**.  It keeps track of the lowest and
highest values that so far have been sent to **in**, in two variables
*min_current* and *max_current*. Mathematically, it returns (**in** -
*min_current*) / (*max_current* - *min_current*) + **min** *
(**max**-**min**).

**reset** deletes the current *min_current* and *max_current*.

**freeze** stops updating *min_current* and *max_current* from **in**; 
values outside those boundaries will be clamped to **min** and **max**, respectively.

**poly** changes the polyphonic behaviour. If **poly** is off, a single pair of
*min_current* and *max_current* values will be computed from inputs on all channels.
Set to on, each channel will track its own set of *min_current* and *max_current*.

The **min** and **max** outputs return the values for *min_current* and *max_current*.
They will be polyphonic if **in** is polyphonic and **poly** is on.
